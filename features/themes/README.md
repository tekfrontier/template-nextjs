# Theme Info

By default this project uses mui's [CSS theme variables](https://mui.com/material-ui/experimental-api/css-theme-variables/overview/) to provide themes. You can use these tools to build your own custom theme.

* [mui-theme-creator](https://zenoo.github.io/mui-theme-creator/)
* [color tools](https://www.colors.tools/color-harmonies/)
* [Hex/RGB color converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/hex-to-rgb.html)

Note that the scrollbar has been made to coincide with the theme by editing the [global.css](../../app/[locale]/globals.css) file. If you change the theme, you may need to update the scrollbar colors.

Two logos (one for dark mode and one for light) have been included in the [public](../../public/) directory and are referenced by the [Logo](../shared/components/nav/Logo.jsx) component.
